## 🚀 How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Start at the Top**: Begin with foundational topics like Hardware, OS, and Networking.
2. **Build Progressively**: Move from General → Software → Tools → Security.
3. **Practice Constantly**: Use virtual machines, CTFs, and real-world labs.
4. **Certify Strategically**: Prioritize certs like CHFI, For500, or Security+ early; pursue SANS courses as you advance.
5. **Specialize Later**: Once comfortable with core areas, focus on niches like Memory Forensics, Mobile, car, or Cloud.

> 💡 **Tip**: Don’t try to learn everything at once. Focus on one domain per month and do hands-on operations.
